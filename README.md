A simple React + TypeScript project demonstrating a **professional, reusable pagination component** integrated with data fetching from the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API.

 â”œâ”€ components/
 â”‚   â””â”€ Pagination.tsx       # Reusable Pagination component
 â”œâ”€ App.tsx                  # Main application file with data fetching and pagination

## Usage

- The app fetches posts once when it loads.
- Posts are displayed in pages with a default of 2 posts per page.
- Click page numbers or Prev/Next buttons to navigate.
- The pagination component automatically adjusts page numbers and shows ellipsis for large page counts.

---

## Customization

- Adjust `postsPerPage` in `App.tsx` to show more or fewer posts per page.
- Modify colors and styles easily by editing the Tailwind CSS classes in `Pagination.tsx`.
- The pagination component accepts these props:
  - `currentPage`: current active page number.
  - `totalPages`: total number of pages.
  - `onPageChange`: callback fired with new page number on user interaction.
